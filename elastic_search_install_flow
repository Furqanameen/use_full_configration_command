Prerequisites
Before following this tutorial, you will need:

An Ubuntu 20.04 server with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs set up with a non-root sudo user. You can achieve this by following the Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04
OpenJDK 11 installed

curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install elasticsearch


Start the Elasticsearch service with systemctl. Give Elasticsearch a few moments to start up. Otherwise, you may get errors about not being able to connect.

sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
Next, run the following command to enable Elasticsearch to start up every time your server boots:

sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch

Step 4 â€” Testing Elasticsearch
By now, Elasticsearch should be running on port 9200. You can test it with cURL and a GET request.

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200'
