Prerequisites
Before following this tutorial, you will need:

An Ubuntu 20.04 server with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs set up with a non-root sudo user. You can achieve this by following the Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04
OpenJDK 11 installed

curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install elasticsearch


Start the Elasticsearch service with systemctl. Give Elasticsearch a few moments to start up. Otherwise, you may get errors about not being able to connect.

sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml No need to update this file.
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
systemctl status elasticsearch.service
Next, run the following command to enable Elasticsearch to start up every time your server boots:

Step 4 â€” Testing Elasticsearch
By now, Elasticsearch should be running on port 9200. You can test it with cURL and a GET request.

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200'
if its working fine then congrate!..

Next to check 
open rails console and create index 
Product.import force: true
to check index run this command curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices'


for delete index
Product.__elasticsearch__.delete_index! for index deletion.
Product.import force: true index creation.
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service  elastic search service start.
