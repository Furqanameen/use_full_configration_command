Updating systemThere has been an error while updating your system using `apt-get`.
It seems that there are some 404 Not Found errors for repositories listed in:

    /etc/apt/sources.list
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list

Make sure that all repositories are available from your system and verify your setup by running manually:

    sudo apt-get update

Make sure that it works correctly before proceeding with RVM.

If you are working from the GUI instead of the terminal, you might want to verify and fix broken
repositories using "Software & Updates" application.
